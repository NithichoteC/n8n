The `$fromAI()` function is only available for [app node](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/index.md) tools connected to the Tools Agent. It isn't possible to use the `$fromAI()` function with the [Call n8n Workflow](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow.md), [Code](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolcode.md), [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolhttprequest.md), or [other cluster sub-nodes](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/index.md).
///

To use the `$fromAI()` function, call it with the required `key` parameter:

```javascript
{{ $fromAI('email') }}
```

The `key` parameter and other arguments to the `$fromAI()` function aren't references to existing values. Instead, think of these arguments as hints that the AI model will use to populate the right data.

For instance, if you choose a key called `email`, the AI Model will look for an email address in its context, other tools, and input data. In chat workflows, it may ask the user for an email address if it can't find one elsewhere. You can optionally pass other parameters like `description` to give extra context to the AI model.

### Parameters

The `$fromAI()` function accepts the following parameters:

<!-- vale off -->

| Parameter | Type | Required? | Description |
| --------- | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| `key` | string | :white_check_mark: | A string representing the key or name of the argument. This must be between 1 and 64 characters in length and can only contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. |
| `description` | string | :x: | A string describing the argument. |
| `type` | string | :x: | A string specifying the data type. Can be string, number, boolean, or json (defaults to string). |
| `defaultValue` | any | :x: | The default value to use for the argument. |

<!-- vale on -->

### Examples

As an example, you could use the following `$fromAI()` expression to dynamically populate a field with a name:

```javascript
$fromAI("name", "The commenter's name", "string", "Jane Doe")
```

If you don't need the optional parameters, you could simplify this as:

```javascript
$fromAI("name")
```

To dynamically populate the number of items you have in stock, you could use a `$fromAI()` expression like this:

```javascript
$fromAI("numItemsInStock", "Number of items in stock", "number", 5)
```

If you only want to fill in parts of a field with a dynamic value from the model, you can use it in a normal expression as well. For example, if you want the model to fill out the `subject` parameter for an e-mail, but always pre-fix the generated value with the string 'Generated by AI:', you could use the following expression:

```javascript
Generated by AI: {{ $fromAI("subject") }}
```
