### Scoped API keys
Users on the Enterprise plan can now create API keys with specific scopes to control exactly what each key can access.

Previously, API keys had full read/write access across all endpoints. While sometimes necessary, this level of access can be excessive and too powerful for most use cases.  Scoped API keys allow you to limit access to only the resources and actions a service or user actually needs.

**What‚Äôs new**

When creating a new API key, you can now:

- Select whether the key has read, write, or both types of access.  
- Specify which resources the key can interact with.  

Supported scopes include:

- Variables ‚Äî list, create, delete  
- Security audit ‚Äî generate reports  
- Projects ‚Äî list, create, update, delete  
- Executions ‚Äî list, read, delete  
- Credentials ‚Äî list, create, update, delete, move  
- Workflows ‚Äî list, create, update, delete, move, add/remove tags  

Scoped API keys give you more control and security. You can limit access to only what‚Äôs needed, making it safer to work with third parties and easier to manage internal API usage.

### Drag and Drop in Folders

Folders just got friendlier. With this release, you can now **drag and drop workflows and folders** ‚Äî making it even easier to keep things tidy.

Need to reorganize? Just select a workflow or folder and drag it into another folder or breadcrumb location. It‚Äôs a small change that makes a big difference when managing a growing collection of workflows.
